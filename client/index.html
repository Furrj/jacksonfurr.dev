			<h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
			<p style="text-align: left;">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi there! My name is Jackson Furr and I'm a full stack developer currently in
				my last term of the
				Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science program here at SNHU. Throughout my time in the program, I have
				learned and grown immensely as a developer, and I am excited to show the additional value I can bring to an
				employer by utilizing the skills I have learned. I have around three years of experience as a professional
				backend developer, so my professional experience combined with my school knowledge makes me an asset both in
				frontend and backend development.
				<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout my time in this program, I have gained and improved my skills in many
				disciplines of Computer Science and software development. In the Data Structures and Algorithms course, I
				learned how to measure the speed of algorithms using Big-O Notation and how to use context and project
				requirements to choose the correct data structure for a given task. In the Software Development Lifecycle
				course, I learned a great deal about how to work with stakeholders to deliver a product that meets all
				requirements, as well as how to work in a distributed team environment. This process involves utilizing both the
				SCRUM framework and the Agile methodology, wherein development is driven by fulfilling stakeholder needs and
				customer stories. In my UI/UX design class, I learned how to develop consistent and intuitive front ends for
				websites and applications. This includes creating interfaces that are accessible for all types of users, both
				technical and nontechnical. In the Fullstack Development course, I learned how to design an application with a
				frontend and backend that work together, as well as how to use a database to store customer data. This process
				includes designing a backend CRUD API that allows user to alter data in the database through making requests to
				the backend, assuming they have been properly authenticated and they are authorized to interact with said
				endpoints. For authentication, I am familiar with using JWT technology that includes signed access and refresh
				tokens that verify the user's identity. In the Reverse Engineering and Software Security courses, I learned
				about common vulnerabilities of software and how to prevent these attack vectors by using industry standard best
				practices. I learned the importance of keeping packages up to date to ensure that security patches are applied,
				as well as how to check common CVE releases to ensure that any software I'm using does not have any active
				vulnerabilities. I also worked with fellow students I met through classes on several personal projects, and
				these projects helped me learn how to work in a collaborative environment and effectively communicate with
				teammates.
				<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enhancement of this artifact shows how my skills as a developer have improved
				throughout my time in this program in three key areas: software design and engineering, algorithms and data
				structures, and databases. The artifact that I enhanced to show improvement in these three areas is a program
				known as “Todo 2.0”, which allows users to add and remove items from a Todo list. I created the original item a
				little over 2 years ago before I had started the CS program here, and as such it needs improvement in many
				areas. It was originally written using the MERN stack, and as part of my enhancement I transitioned the backend
				language from JavaScript to Go and transitioned the database from MongoDB to Postgres. I also implemented a
				Quicksort algorithm which sorts the user's Todo items by their sequential IDs to ensure that they are in order
				when being sent to the front end.

				<i>Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?</i>
			<p class="narrative">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This artifact is the server for a personal project called “Todo 2.0”. It is a web
				application
				that allows users to add and remove “todo” items from a list, so that they may track their productivity. It runs
				on the MERN stack currently, meaning it uses JS as the core language, Node as the JS runtime, Express as the
				HTTP server, MongoDB as the database, and React for the frontend client. It was initially created a little over
				2 years ago as a personal project so that I could better learn how the MERN stack functioned.
			</p>
			<br>
			<i>Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio.</i>
			<p class="narrative">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I selected this item because it is a simple and straightforward project but includes all
				three areas of
				improvement that I must showcase for the capstone. It also presents a great opportunity to show how my skills as
				a developer have improved over the years, as I now have the ability to transition it to an entirely new language
				and database technology. The architecture of the server and the transition from Express/JS to Gin/Golang both
				showcase my software development skills, as it proves that I understand the flow of a server enough to implement
				it in multiple languages and paradigms. I improved the artifact by performing the aforementioned rewrite in
				Golang, which allows the server to run faster and be deployed more easily.
			</p>
			<br>
			<i>Reflect on the process of enhancing the artifact.</i>
			<p class="narrative">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mainly learned how the functionality of a language naturally influences the
				architecture and logical flow of
				the software written with it. For example, Express and JS tend to lend themselves to more of a straightforward,
				simple routing pattern when it comes to writing HTTP server functionality. This is because of the ease and
				self-documenting nature of Express syntax. However, Gin and Golang present a slightly more complicated syntax,
				and therefore more documentation must be included, as the code is not self-documenting. One challenge I faced
				was keeping the data types in-sync between the frontend and backend when transitioning to Go. When they were
				both written in JS, it was much easier as I could use the same objects, but when they run on different
				languages, it's slightly harder to ensure that the types are equivalent. To help with this, I transitioned the
				React frontend from JavaScript to TypeScript.

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I selected this item because it presented a great chance to show my skills regarding
				algorithms and data
				structures. The main data structure of this program is an object (or struct in Golang) called a 'Todo', which
				features three fields: an unsigned integer called the “ID”, a string called the “Title”, and a string called the
				“Content”. The ID is a unique numeric key that is used to identify each Todo, and because of how Postgres works
				(which will be used to store the Todos in the next milestone), the array of Todos retrieved will not always be
				in order of these numeric ID's. The end user seeing the Todos on the frontend will want to see these Todos in
				order, therefore I implemented an algorithm known as “quicksort” to sort the array of Todos in ascending order
				of ID's before sending it to the frontend. This combination of designing and using the Todo data structure and
				sorting them with an algorithm showcases my skills in these areas.
			</p>
			<br>
			<i>Reflect on the process of enhancing the artifact.</i>
			<p class="narrative">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned that I did not understand the quicksort algorithm as well as I thought I did.
				I previously implemented
				a quicksort algorithm in C++ in the data structures and algorithms course, but I had not practiced implementing
				algorithms since then and therefore I was a little rusty. I had to watch some YouTube videos on how they worked,
				and it took some trial and error to get it right. I now feel that I have a much greater understanding of these
				algorithms, as well as recursion.

				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I selected this item because it presented a great chance to show my skills regarding
				implementing a database
				into a software project. This program needs a database so that the Todo items can be used across different
				sessions, as storing them in-memory would mean they would disappear whenever the executable stops running,
				making updates impossible. At the same time, it only needed two database objects, the Todo and User objects,
				which means it was fairly straightforward to implement. I implemented communication with a Postgres backend
				which consisted of a database named 'Todo' and two tables, one named “Users” and one named “Todos”. The API
				routes interacted with this database through a driver for Golang known as 'pgx' and I used prepared SQL queries
				to interact with Postgres directly instead of using an ORM.
			</p>
			<br>
			<i>Reflect on the process of enhancing the artifact.</i>
			<p class="narrative">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned that, while good practice for SQL, writing prepared statements instead of
				using an ORM can make the
				process more difficult, especially when it comes to refactors. Anytime I wanted to add a column to a database
				table, it required making changes in three separate places: the SQL statements for creating the table, the SQL
				statements for querying the table, and the Go functions for executing the SQL statements. Although ORM's can
				slow down performance, in bigger more complicated projects I can see how they may be useful. A good compromise
				would be using a code-gen solution that allows you to still use SQL but generates the statements for you based
				on the Golang structs.
