			<h2>Professional Self-Assessment</h2>
			<p style="text-align: left;">
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi there! My name is Jackson Furr and I'm a full stack developer currently in
				my last term of the
				Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science program here at SNHU. Throughout my time in the program, I have
				learned and grown immensely as a developer, and I am excited to show the additional value I can bring to an
				employer by utilizing the skills I have learned. I have around three years of experience as a professional
				backend developer, so my professional experience combined with my school knowledge makes me an asset both in
				frontend and backend development.
				<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Throughout my time in this program, I have gained and improved my skills in many
				disciplines of Computer Science and software development. In the Data Structures and Algorithms course, I
				learned how to measure the speed of algorithms using Big-O Notation and how to use context and project
				requirements to choose the correct data structure for a given task. In the Software Development Lifecycle
				course, I learned a great deal about how to work with stakeholders to deliver a product that meets all
				requirements, as well as how to work in a distributed team environment. This process involves utilizing both the
				SCRUM framework and the Agile methodology, wherein development is driven by fulfilling stakeholder needs and
				customer stories. In my UI/UX design class, I learned how to develop consistent and intuitive front ends for
				websites and applications. This includes creating interfaces that are accessible for all types of users, both
				technical and nontechnical. In the Fullstack Development course, I learned how to design an application with a
				frontend and backend that work together, as well as how to use a database to store customer data. This process
				includes designing a backend CRUD API that allows user to alter data in the database through making requests to
				the backend, assuming they have been properly authenticated and they are authorized to interact with said
				endpoints. For authentication, I am familiar with using JWT technology that includes signed access and refresh
				tokens that verify the user's identity. In the Reverse Engineering and Software Security courses, I learned
				about common vulnerabilities of software and how to prevent these attack vectors by using industry standard best
				practices. I learned the importance of keeping packages up to date to ensure that security patches are applied,
				as well as how to check common CVE releases to ensure that any software I'm using does not have any active
				vulnerabilities. I also worked with fellow students I met through classes on several personal projects, and
				these projects helped me learn how to work in a collaborative environment and effectively communicate with
				teammates.
				<br>
				<br>
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The enhancement of this artifact shows how my skills as a developer have improved
				throughout my time in this program in three key areas: software design and engineering, algorithms and data
				structures, and databases. The artifact that I enhanced to show improvement in these three areas is a program
				known as “Todo 2.0”, which allows users to add and remove items from a Todo list. I created the original item a
				little over 2 years ago before I had started the CS program here, and as such it needs improvement in many
				areas. It was originally written using the MERN stack, and as part of my enhancement I transitioned the backend
				language from JavaScript to Go and transitioned the database from MongoDB to Postgres. I also implemented a
				Quicksort algorithm which sorts the user's Todo items by their sequential IDs to ensure that they are in order
				when being sent to the front end.
